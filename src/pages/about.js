                            I am a {Math.floor((new Date() - new Date('1999-07-06')) / (31557600000))} year old engineering student at Ghent University. 
                            Ever since I was young(er) I've had a fascination with science and technology, starting to build websites and computers and experimenting with 3D printing and Arduino boards from secondary school onwards.
