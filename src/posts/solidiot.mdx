Last year, during my bachelor thesis at Ghent University and subsequent internship at Digipolis Ghent (now District09), I had the pleasure of collaborating on a set of projects that explore the use of Solid Pods for storage of Internet of Things sensor data. While working on these projects was very interesting and rewarding, I felt like something was still missing. In the technical reports, it is thoroughly described what we did and how we achieved this. However, in this article I want to place the work in its context and hopefully spark your interest in the topic at hand.

## What is Solid?

### The World Wide Web

Before diving into the Solid project, I want to take a step back and have a look at the [world wide web](https://www.w3.org/History.html).<br></br>
The web, as invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, consists of three core technologies:

- An identification system for the documents on the web: **Universal Resource Locator/Identifier** (URL/URI).
- A publishing language to describe the content of those documents: **Hypertext Markup Language** (HTML).
- A protocol for transferring these documents over the internet: **Hypertext Transfer Protocol** (HTTP).

The combination of these technologies (with others) truly revolutionized the way society works. To say anything less would be an incredible understatement. [59 percent](https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/) of the global population actively uses the internet, on average spending [2 hours and 41 minutes](https://www.statista.com/statistics/319732/daily-time-spent-online-device/) online per day. The reach of the web results in such unfathomable statistics that they can only be grasped by [experiencing them](https://www.webfx.com/internet-real-time/).

While the web has been one of the main driving sources in the democratization of information, education and innovation over the past three decades, not everything is puppies and rainbows either. In his article on the thirtieth anniversary of the web, Tim identifies three sources of dysfunction on the web:

> 1. **Deliberate, malicious intent**, such as state-sponsored hacking and attacks, criminal behaviour, and online harassment.
> 2. **System design that creates perverse incentives** where user value is sacrificed, such as ad-based revenue models that  commercially reward clickbait and the viral spread of misinformation.
> 3. **Unintended negative consequences** of benevolent design, such as the outraged and polarised tone and quality of online discourse.

An additional consequence of the ad-based revenue models mentioned in point two is the urge for corporations to track our every move in order to make their advertisements better targeted and hence more effective. In her book [*The age of Surveillance Capitalism*](https://shoshanazuboff.com/book/about/), Shoshana Zuboff describes this phenomenon as a threat to privacy, freedom and democracy.

The argument in favor of these data processing and advertisement models is that they allow us to use these web-services for free. However, there are multiple forms of freedom. In the open software world, two forms of freedom are distinguished:

- Free as in "free beer" (gratis). This is the model that most apps uses, in which no payment is required for the user to enjoy the service.
- Free as in "freedom of speech" (libre), which signifies the liberty to use, study and change the program without in any way the user desires.

Furthermore, in his essay [*Two Concepts of Liberty*](http://cactus.dixie.edu/green/B_Readings/I_Berlin%20Two%20Concpets%20of%20Liberty.pdf), the philosopher Isaiah Berlin identifies two forms of liberty, the second form of freedom:

- Negative liberty, which can best be explained as the freedom from certain limitations or oppressions that limit the possibility to act.
- Postive liberty on the other hand is related to the agency of an individual to decide what to do with the freedom available.

In this regard, the web is a strange space. It is free in the sense that we have platforms that offer the liberty to connect with one another and achieve things previously imaginable at no monetary cost. On the other hand, they really aren't as users mostly lack the ability to change or even influence how these platforms work and cannot escape the ever increasing data collection that the companies behind them are chasing.

Having identified these issues, Berners-Lee is not planning to sit back and wait until they magically go away. As a response, he started the Solid project in 2016. In 2018, he launched a commercial venture, [Inrupt](https://inrupt.com), to provide the Solid project with sufficient commercial energy.

### The Solid Project

So what is this silver bullet that should solve all the web's issues?<br></br>The main premise of Solid is to turn the distribution of data on the web on its head, or perhaps more accurately [right side up](https://inrupt.com/turning-the-privacy-world-right-side-up). Rather than a person's data being scattered over dozens of impenetrable systems or "data silos" (social media, government, job platforms, etc.), Solid proposes to combine all of it and store it in a personal storage Pod. Applications that need access to your personal data can then request permission to use or change it.

[![How Solid Pods Work](./solidiot.assets/solidworks.png)](https://inrupt.com/solid)

"Hold on!", I hear you say, "Why should I trust Solid or Inrupt with all of my data?"<br></br>
The beautiful thing is: you don't have to. Solid is not a product that can only be sold by one company. Just like HTML and HTTP, it is an open standard. As a result, multiple providers can host and offer Solid Pods for you to choose from. And if you trust no-one, you could still take the route of self-hosting a server.

In the end, the Solid Project is about choice. Putting the users back in control of their data allows them to decide which form of freedom they deem more important: monetary or otherwise. The further implications this change would have in terms of [paradigm shifts for web applications](https://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2017/12/20/paradigm-shifts-for-the-decentralized-web/) and how this could unlock [increased innovation and economic growth](https://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2020/12/07/a-data-ecosystem-fosters-sustainable-innovation/) are beyond the scope of this article and are already explained better than I could have in Ruben Verborgh's blog posts.

## Internet of Things

The Internet of Things (IoT) was first [coined](https://www.rfidjournal.com/that-internet-of-things-thing) as a term by Kevin Ashton in 1999 which describes a system where devices collect, process and communicate data with each other without the need for human intervention. In more practical terms, David Rose explains the concept in [*Enchanted Objects*](https://enchantedobjects.com/#/enchanted-objects/), where the objects we already use today get "smart", come to know us and respond to our needs. This is a simple yet powerful concept with many application fields, from autonomous vehicles in agriculture and [smart manufacturing](https://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/internet/the-industrial-internet-of-things) to the [quantified self](https://quantifiedself.com/) and [medical applications](https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/life-sciences-and-healthcare/articles/medtech-internet-of-medical-things.html). Ashton put it this way:

> The Internet of Things has the potential to change the world, just like the internet did. Maybe even more so.

While the tremendous growth of the field over the past decades seems to confirm these insights, there still remains significant hurdles to be overcome. Not least of which are the issues of [platform fragmentation](https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2016/02/19/fragmentation-enemy-internet-things) and concerns about [privacy](https://madsg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Designing_the_Internet_of_Things.pdf#p303). Now, if these issues sound familiar then we're thinking in the same direction. A lack of interoperability and transparency when it comes to data handling is precisely what Solid is attempting to solve. Wouldn't it be interesting then, to marry both of these concepts?

The idea of applying the advantages of the web, and even the semantic web, to the Internet of Things in order to solve some of its problems is not new. Companies like Siemens and Google as well as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) have dedicated research groups to investigate this phenomenon called the [Web of Things](https://www.w3.org/WoT/) or the [Physical Web](http://google.github.io/physical-web/). However, as the Solid project is just starting to mature, very little information is available on how these technologies can be combined.
