When I was 15 I started watching tutorials on the internet on **how to build websites**.
The first one I deployed was for my mother's opticians shop.

Over the following years I built up more knowledge and improved my **programming and design skills**.

To this day it still pleases me whenever my mother receives a compliment on her good looking website.
