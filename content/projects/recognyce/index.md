Inspired by the [PIGEON](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05845v4) project that uses **computer vision** to beat humans at [Geoguessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/),
we built a minigame where users are served pictures taken in New York City and have to determine what borough they were taken in.

Simultaneously, we developed and trained **deep learning models** to perform the same task. In the end, the models proved **superior to human players**.
