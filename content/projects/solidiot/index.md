In 2020, during my **bachelor thesis** at Ghent University and subsequent **internship** at [Digipolis Ghent (now District09)](https://district09.gent/), I had the pleasure of collaborating on a set of projects that explore the use of **Solid Pods** for storage of **Internet of Things** sensor data.
