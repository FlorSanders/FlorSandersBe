I will never be a chess grandmaster.  
However, modern AI techniques allow engineers to create systems that can beat human players. Even grandmasters.

This project explores the field of common **reinforcement learning** techniques, such as **deep Q learning** and **actor-critic models**
to build a computer engine capable of playing [chess on a hexagonal board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_chess).
