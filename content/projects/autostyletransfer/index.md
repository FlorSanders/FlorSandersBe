Curious about what makes **generative AI** models tick, I started this project to automatically transcribe musical pieces from one genre to another.

Exploring and implementing twin **variational autoencoders (VAE)** and **generative adversarial networks (GANs)**,
I uncovered little by little the mysteries, challenges and victories that brought us success stories like [Meta Musicgen](https://audiocraft.metademolab.com/musicgen.html).
