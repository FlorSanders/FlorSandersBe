SOLA is a Smart Offline-first LLM Assistant.
By adopting an **offline-first** approach to data and model execution, **privacy** is guaranteed.
Still, its integration with **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and access to external (online) **tools** make it smart.

SOLA integrates a range of **open-source** speech and language models and targets the **low-power** Nvidia Jetson Nano as its deployment platform for inference on **the edge**.
