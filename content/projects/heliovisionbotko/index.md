At Botko and Heliovision, I actively contributed to **automation and quality assurance** projects for industrial applications. The focus was on integrating **industrial and collaborative robots** with **machine vision algorithms** in order to build technologically powerful solutions.

My efforts also placed a strong emphasis on user experience through the development of **intuitive <abbr title="graphical user interfaces">GUIs</abbr>**.
