My master thesis project proposed a novel **system-on-chip** integration platform for wireless communication systems in the **D-band** mmWave frequency range (110 - 170 GHz).

The research contributes to advancing high-frequency wireless communication, allowing for **improved efficiency** and **decreased cost** for passive D-band devices.
