Impressed by how far open source **computer vision** models have come in the past few years, we wanted to explore their application in the field of **sports analysis and coaching**.

In this project, we detect the player's **3D poses** and **2D positions** on the **tennis** field. These features are then used to perform classification of the style of tennis shot, by making use of a custom architecture containing **graph and recursive neural networks**.
