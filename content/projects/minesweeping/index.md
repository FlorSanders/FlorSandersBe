During my first master I followed UGent's course on **Robotics**, which has a large hands-on project component.

We were assigned the task of developing **algorithms** for **autonomous** minesweeping in an unknown environment.

Different approaches were implemented using the [**Robot Operating System**](https://www.ros.org) and evaluated for performance.
