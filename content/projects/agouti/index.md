During the summer of 2021, I collaborated on the wildlife camera trapping project at [Wageningen University and Research](https://www.wur.nl/).

My role was to **streamline image processing** for enhanced speed, **fortify the data upload system**, and **refine the SQL database** for optimal performance and maintainability.
