In this mid-master project a **remote antenna unit** with beamsteering capabilities was designed, realized and characterized.

The antenna array is built for use at **mmWave frequencies** with 5G and beyond-5G applications in mind.

The implementation details and result are currently kept under <abbr title="non-disclosure agreement">NDA</abbr>.
