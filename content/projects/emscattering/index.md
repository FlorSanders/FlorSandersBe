UGent's course on Applied Electromagnetism was my first introduction to the field of **computational electromagnetism**.

The project related to this course required us to develop a 2D **FDTD** solver in order to study the scattering of EM waves from dielectric objects.

Ever since, I have loved doing any **scientific computing** in **Python**.
