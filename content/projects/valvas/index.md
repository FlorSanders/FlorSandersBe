[Redpencil.io](https://redpencil.io/) was my first client as a freelance software developer.

They make use of **open standards** and **linked data** to make the flemish government both more efficient and more transparent.

I updated the Valvas app to **Ember octane** and refactored both the frontend and backend to support their **new data model**.
